# Colors

Every website has it own color palette. Your's too. The ExyCSS framework contains a total of 19 colors, with 9 variations of each, so a big total of 171 colors.
It's pretty simple to use it : place any text with `exy-color__name-variation` to color it.

```html
<p class="exy-color__blue-500">I'm a blue text !</p>
```

To color the background of any element, just add **-back** at the end of the class.

```html
<div class="exy-color__red-300-back">
I'm a red div !
</div>
```

This will color the borders too.
