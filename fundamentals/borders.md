# Borders

Add some borders to any element to give it a sort of independence in the page. They give a style to an element.  
To place a border on an element, just add the `exy-border__width` class. Replace width with yours.

```html
<div class="exy-border__1">
  Div with a 1px border
</div>
```

**Available widths :** 1 to 50.

If you want to have round corners, just add the `exy-border__radius-value` class to your element. Replace value by the radius of round corners.

```html
<div class="exy-border__2 exy-border__radius-1">
  Div with a 2px border and a radius of 1
</div>
```

**Available radius :** 1 to 50.
